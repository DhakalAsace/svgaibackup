   - Upload interface functional
   - Drag-and-drop zone present
   - Conversion settings available
   - SEO content and features listed
   - 40,500 monthly searches targeted

2. **SVG to PNG Converter** (/convert/svg-to-png)

#### ‚ùå Error State (Need Fixing)
1. **SVG to PDF Converter** (/convert/svg-to-pdf)
   - Runtime error: Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/@opentelemetry.js'
   - Webpack bundling issue
   - 8,100 monthly searches targeted

2. **WebP to SVG Converter** (/convert/webp-to-svg)
   - Same runtime error as SVG to PDF
   - Needs module resolution fix
   - 1,900 monthly searches targeted

#### üîú Coming Soon (Placeholders)
Based on the hub page, most converters show "Coming Soon" status, including:
- Image to SVG Converter
- SVG to JPG Converter
- JPEG to SVG Converter
- EPS to SVG Converter
- SVG to DXF Converter
- And approximately 30+ others

### Technical Observations

1. **File Structure**
   - Individual pages exist for: png-to-svg, svg-to-png, jpg-to-svg, svg-converter, svg-to-mp4
   - Dynamic catch-all route: [converter]/page.tsx handles remaining converters
   - This explains the errors - dynamic route likely has bundling issues

2. **UI/UX Consistency**
   - All working converters share consistent design
   - Clear upload zones with drag-and-drop
   - Feature lists and conversion steps
   - Professional appearance

3. **Performance**
   - Pages load quickly
   - No significant lag in navigation
   - Client-side ready for conversion implementation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Module Bundling Error**
   - Resolve '@opentelemetry.js' dependency issue
   - Affects dynamic [converter] route
   - Will unblock 35+ converters

2. **Verify All 40 Converters**
   - One converter missing from hub (39 vs 40 listed)
   - Add missing converter to hub page

3. **Implement Core Converters**
   - Focus on high-traffic converters first:
     - SVG to PDF (8,100 searches) - currently broken
     - WebP to SVG (1,900 searches) - currently broken
     - SVG to JPG (6,600 searches)
     - PDF to SVG (5,400 searches)

### Next Steps
1. **Complete Client-Side Implementation**
   - Add actual conversion logic using:
     - Potrace for raster to vector
     - Canvas API for vector to raster
     - PDF.js for PDF operations

2. **SEO Optimization**
   - Add unique content for each converter
   - Include technical specifications
   - Add comparison tables
   - Create use case examples

3. **Testing Suite**
   - Implement automated testing for all converters
   - Test actual file conversions
   - Verify output quality
   - Monitor performance metrics

## Conclusion

The converter infrastructure is well-structured with 3 fully functional converters demonstrating the intended user experience. The main blocker is a webpack bundling error affecting the dynamic route that handles the remaining ~35 converters. Once fixed, all converters should display their placeholder pages with "Coming Soon" status, ready for implementation of the actual conversion logic.

The SEO foundation is strong with proper URL structure, metadata, and content templates. Priority should be fixing the runtime error, then systematically implementing converters based on search volume.
