# Supabase Database Audit Report

Generated: 2025-01-21

## Executive Summary

After a comprehensive audit of the Supabase database schema and code implementation, I found the system is **generally coherent** with a few areas that need attention:

1. **Missing Table in Types**: The `subscriptions` table exists in the database but is missing some monitoring-related tables in the TypeScript types.
2. **Storage Cleanup Queue Security**: The `storage_cleanup_queue` table has RLS enabled but no policies defined.
3. **Subscription Management**: The `subscriptions` table only has SELECT policies, missing INSERT/UPDATE policies.

## Database Schema vs TypeScript Types

### ✅ Tables Correctly Mapped
- `profiles` - User profiles with subscription and credit tracking
- `svg_designs` - SVG design storage
- `daily_generation_limits` - Rate limiting for generations
- `webhook_events` - Stripe webhook event tracking
- `payment_audit_log` - Payment audit trail
- `generated_videos` - Video generation tracking
- `subscriptions` - Subscription records
- `storage_cleanup_queue` - Cleanup task queue

### ⚠️ Tables in TypeScript but Not in Database
The following tables are defined in `types/database.types.ts` but don't exist in the actual database:
- `monitoring_metrics`
- `funnel_conversions`
- `monitoring_alerts`
- `web_vitals_logs`
- `performance_alerts`
- `error_groups`
- `error_events`
- `synthetic_checks`
- `uptime_metrics`
- `analytics_events`
- `conversion_metrics`
- `redirect_logs`

**Recommendation**: Either create these tables if they're needed, or remove them from the types file.

## Row Level Security (RLS) Analysis

### ✅ Properly Secured Tables
1. **profiles** (4 policies)
   - Users can view/update their own profile
   - Service role has full access
   - Properly restricts access to user's own data

2. **svg_designs** (5 policies)
   - Full CRUD for own designs
   - Public read access for `is_public = true`
   - Well-structured security model

3. **generated_videos** (3 policies)
   - Users can view/insert/update their own videos
   - Properly restricts access by user_id

4. **daily_generation_limits** (2 policies)
   - Users can read their own limits
   - Service role has full access

5. **payment_audit_log** (3 policies)
   - Service role only for insert/update
   - Users can view their own logs

### ⚠️ Security Issues

1. **storage_cleanup_queue**
   - RLS is enabled but NO policies defined
   - This table should only be accessible by service role
   - **Action Required**: Add service role only policy

2. **subscriptions**
   - Only has SELECT policy
   - Missing INSERT/UPDATE policies for service role
   - **Action Required**: Add service role policies for INSERT/UPDATE

## Code Implementation Review

### ✅ Correct Database Operations

1. **Credit Management** (`CreditContext.tsx`)
   - Correctly reads from profiles table
   - Properly handles subscription vs lifetime credits
   - Real-time updates via postgres_changes

2. **Video Generation** (`svg-to-video/route.ts`)
   - Properly checks credits before generation
   - Correctly inserts into generated_videos table
   - Updates credit usage after successful generation
   - Handles expiration dates based on tier

3. **Webhook Processing** (`webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)
   - Deduplicates events using webhook_events table
   - Updates both subscriptions and profiles tables
   - Maintains consistency between tables

4. **Storage Cleanup** (`scheduled-storage-cleanup/index.ts`)
   - Correctly processes storage_cleanup_queue
   - Marks items as processed
   - Cleans up old entries

### ⚠️ Potential Issues

1. **Missing Monitoring Tables**
   - Code references monitoring tables that don't exist
   - May cause runtime errors if monitoring features are used

2. **Type Safety**
   - Some tables in types but not in database could cause TypeScript to miss errors

## Storage Configuration

### ✅ Storage Bucket
- `generated-svgs` bucket exists and is public
- No file size or MIME type restrictions
- Appropriate for storing generated content

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add RLS policy for storage_cleanup_queue**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Service role only access" ON storage_cleanup_queue
FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

2. **Add missing policies for subscriptions table**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Service role can insert subscriptions" ON subscriptions
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

CREATE POLICY "Service role can update subscriptions" ON subscriptions
FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

### Medium Priority
3. **Clean up TypeScript types** - Remove non-existent monitoring tables from `types/database.types.ts` or create them if needed

4. **Add DELETE policy for generated_videos** to allow users to delete their own videos

### Low Priority
5. **Consider adding indexes** for frequently queried columns:
   - `profiles.stripe_customer_id`
   - `generated_videos.user_id` + `created_at`
   - `daily_generation_limits.identifier` + `generation_date`

## Conclusion

The database and code are generally well-aligned with proper security measures in place. The main issues are:
1. Missing RLS policies for storage_cleanup_queue
2. Incomplete policies for subscriptions table
3. TypeScript types include tables that don't exist in the database

These issues should be addressed to ensure complete security and prevent potential runtime errors.
