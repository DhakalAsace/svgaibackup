    'PNG-SVG': `Converting PNG raster images to SVG vectors is a transformative process that unlocks infinite scalability for your graphics. This conversion uses advanced edge detection algorithms and path tracing techniques to analyze pixel boundaries and recreate them as mathematical curves. Our ${title} employs the same vectorization technology used by professional design software, making it ideal for converting logos, icons, and simple graphics that need to scale from business cards to billboards without quality loss.

Unlike simple image format changes, PNG to SVG conversion requires intelligent interpretation of your raster data. Our tool analyzes color boundaries, detects shapes, and optimizes paths to create clean, efficient SVG code. This process is particularly valuable for web developers seeking performance optimization, designers needing print-ready graphics, and businesses wanting to future-proof their visual assets.

Based on processing millions of conversions, we've optimized our algorithm to handle common PNG scenarios: logos with transparency, icons with sharp edges, and graphics with limited color palettes. The converter automatically adjusts its tracing parameters based on your image characteristics, ensuring optimal results whether you're converting a simple icon or a complex illustration.`,

    'SVG-PNG': `Converting SVG to PNG represents the essential process of rasterization - transforming infinite mathematical precision into pixel-perfect images for universal compatibility. This conversion is crucial when your vector graphics need to work in environments that don't support SVG, such as email clients, social media platforms, or legacy systems. Our ${title} renders your vectors at any resolution you need, from tiny thumbnails to high-resolution print graphics.

The challenge in SVG to PNG conversion lies in maintaining visual fidelity while transitioning from vectors to pixels. Our converter uses advanced anti-aliasing algorithms to ensure smooth edges, preserves transparency channels, and accurately renders complex SVG features like gradients, patterns, and filters. We handle everything from simple icons to complex illustrations with nested groups and transformations.

Professional designers and developers rely on this conversion for creating multiple resolution assets from a single source, ensuring consistent branding across platforms, and optimizing graphics for specific use cases. Our tool processes everything client-side, giving you complete control over resolution, quality, and output settings while maintaining the security of your designs.`,

    'JPG-SVG': `Converting JPG photos to SVG vectors presents unique challenges that our ${title} addresses through sophisticated image analysis. Unlike PNG images that often contain logos or graphics, JPG files typically hold photographs with complex color gradients and fine details. Our tool uses adaptive algorithms that can identify and simplify these complexities into vector shapes while maintaining recognizable results.

The key to successful JPG to SVG conversion is understanding that photographic images must be interpreted rather than traced. Our converter employs color quantization to reduce millions of colors to manageable palettes, edge enhancement to define clear boundaries, and intelligent smoothing to create flowing vector paths. This makes it perfect for creating stylized versions of photos, extracting silhouettes, or converting simple photographic elements into scalable graphics.

Years of refinement have taught us that users converting JPG to SVG often seek artistic effects rather than exact reproduction. Whether you're creating vector portraits, converting product photos to line art, or extracting shapes from photographs, our tool provides the flexibility to achieve your creative vision while maintaining professional quality standards.`

    'PNG-SVG': [
      {
        question: "Why does my complex PNG photo look strange after converting to SVG?",
        answer: "SVG is designed for simple graphics with distinct colors and shapes, not photographic images. Our converter uses edge detection to trace boundaries, which works best on logos, icons, and illustrations with clear edges. For photos, consider using the conversion for artistic effects or extracting silhouettes rather than expecting photographic reproduction."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' quality settings?",
        answer: "These settings control the tracing algorithm's sensitivity. 'Low' creates simpler paths with fewer nodes (smaller files, good for simple logos). 'Medium' balances detail and file size. 'High' preserves maximum detail but creates larger files with more complex paths. For web use, Medium often provides the best balance."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I edit the SVG file after conversion?",
        answer: "Absolutely! The resulting SVG contains editable vector paths compatible with Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Figma, and any code editor. You can modify colors, shapes, and paths. The SVG code is clean and organized, making both visual and code-based editing straightforward."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my PNG with transparency convert with a white background?",
        answer: "Our converter preserves transparency when tracing. If you see a white background, it's likely your PNG had a white background that appeared transparent. For best results, use PNGs with true transparency (alpha channel). The converter will create SVG paths only where it detects non-transparent pixels."
      },
      {
        question: "How many colors should my PNG have for best SVG conversion?",
        answer: "Fewer colors produce better results. Logos with 2-5 colors convert perfectly. Images with 10-20 colors work well. Beyond 50 colors, consider pre-processing your PNG to reduce colors. Our converter automatically performs color quantization, but starting with fewer colors yields cleaner vectors."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens to gradients in my PNG during conversion?",
        answer: "Gradients are converted to multiple color bands based on the quality setting. While SVG supports gradients, automatic detection from raster images is complex. For best results with gradients, use our High quality setting or consider manually adding SVG gradients after conversion."
      }
    ],
    'SVG-PNG': [
      {
        question: "What DPI should I use for print vs web?",
        answer: "For web use, 72-96 DPI is standard (matches screen resolution). For print, use 300 DPI for professional quality or 150 DPI for good quality. Our converter automatically calculates pixel dimensions based on your DPI setting. For Retina displays, export at 2x or 3x the display size."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do my SVG animations disappear in the PNG?",
        answer: "PNG is a static image format that captures only the current state of your SVG. Animations, hover effects, and interactive elements cannot be preserved. The converter captures the SVG at its initial state. For animated output, consider our SVG to GIF converter instead."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I export multiple sizes efficiently?",
        answer: "Use our batch processing to export common sizes simultaneously. For app icons, we recommend exporting at 1024x1024 then downscaling. For responsive web images, export at 1x, 2x, and 3x resolutions. The converter maintains aspect ratios automatically when you specify width or height."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens to SVG text elements during conversion?",
        answer: "Text is rendered exactly as displayed in the SVG, using available system fonts. If the SVG uses custom fonts via @font-face, ensure they're loaded before conversion. For consistent results across systems, consider converting text to paths in your SVG before PNG export."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I preserve SVG layers in the PNG output?",
        answer: "PNG doesn't support layers - all SVG elements are flattened into a single image. However, the rendering respects SVG layer order (z-index). For workflows requiring layers, export separate PNGs for each SVG group, or use formats like PSD that support layers."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my PNG look blurry compared to the SVG?",
        answer: "This usually indicates the output resolution is too low. SVGs have infinite resolution, while PNGs are fixed. Ensure you're exporting at sufficient dimensions for your use case. For sharp results, export at least at the maximum display size, or 2x for Retina displays."
      }
    ],
    'JPG-SVG': [
      {
        question: "Can I convert a photograph to a realistic SVG?",
        answer: "SVG excels at geometric shapes, not photographic detail. Our converter creates stylized interpretations by identifying major color regions and edges. This works wonderfully for creating artistic effects, silhouettes, or simplified illustrations from photos, but won't reproduce photographic realism."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the best JPG quality for SVG conversion?",
        answer: "Higher quality JPGs produce better vectors. Compression artifacts in low-quality JPGs confuse edge detection algorithms. For best results, use JPGs saved at 80% quality or higher. If you have the original uncompressed image, use that instead of a compressed JPG."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I convert a scanned logo from JPG to SVG?",
        answer: "First, ensure high scan quality (300+ DPI). Use our 'High Contrast' preprocessing option to sharpen edges. The converter works best with clean, well-lit scans. For logos with text, you may need to recreate text elements using actual fonts after conversion for best results."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my converted SVG have so many small dots?",
        answer: "This indicates image noise or JPG compression artifacts. Use our 'Noise Reduction' option to filter out small elements. Adjusting the 'Minimum Path Size' setting removes tiny paths. For heavily compressed JPGs, consider preprocessing in an image editor first."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I control how many colors appear in the final SVG?",
        answer: "Yes! Our 'Color Palette' setting lets you specify 2-256 colors. Fewer colors create simpler, more stylized vectors. For logos, try 2-8 colors. For artistic effects, 16-32 colors work well. The converter intelligently merges similar colors based on your setting."
