# Storage Retention Analysis for SVGAI.org

## Current Storage Retention Periods

### As Advertised on Pricing Page:
- **Starter Plan ($19/month)**: "7-day generation history"
- **Pro Plan ($39/month)**: "30-day extended history"
- **Free Plan**: No specific retention mentioned

### Actual Implementation:

#### 1. SVG Designs (Icons & SVGs)
- **Free Users**: 7 days retention âœ…
- **Starter Users**: 7 days retention âœ…
- **Pro Users**: 30 days retention âœ…
- **Implementation**: Automatic cleanup via database trigger (1% chance on each insert)
- **Cleanup Function**: `cleanup_old_svg_designs()`

#### 2. Generated Videos
- **Free Users**: 7 days retention âœ…
- **Starter Users**: 7 days retention âœ…
- **Pro Users**: 30 days retention âœ…
- **Implementation**: 
  - Database records have `expires_at` field set based on user tier
  - Cleanup scheduled via pg_cron at 2 AM UTC daily
  - Storage files queued for deletion in `storage_cleanup_queue`
  - Edge Function processes the queue to delete actual files

#### 3. Daily Generation Limits
- **Purpose**: Tracks anonymous user generation limits (1 per day by IP)
- **Retention**: 7 days for IP-based records
- **Cleanup**: Scheduled via pg_cron at 3 AM UTC daily
- **Function**: `cleanup_old_generation_limits()`

## Key Findings:

### âœ… Consistency Verified:
1. **Storage retention matches pricing page** - All tiers have correct retention periods
2. **Applies to ALL content types** - Icons, SVGs, and videos all follow the same rules
3. **Automatic cleanup is configured** - Both database and storage cleanup are scheduled

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details:

#### Credit Costs:
- Icons: 1 credit each
- SVGs: 2 credits each
- Videos: 6 credits each (was defaulted to 10 in DB, now fixed to 6)

#### Cleanup Schedule:
- **2:00 AM UTC**: Video cleanup (`cleanup_expired_videos`)
- **3:00 AM UTC**: Generation limits cleanup (`cleanup_old_generation_limits`)
- **3:00 AM UTC**: Storage queue processing (`trigger_storage_cleanup`)
- **Random**: SVG cleanup (1% chance on each insert operation)

#### What Gets Cleaned:
1. **Expired Videos**: Moved to storage cleanup queue, then deleted from database
2. **Old SVGs**: Deleted directly based on creation date and user tier
3. **Anonymous Limits**: IP-based rate limit records older than 7 days

## Storage Cleanup Process:

1. **Database Cleanup**: Runs automatically via pg_cron or triggers
2. **Storage Queue**: Files to be deleted are added to `storage_cleanup_queue`
3. **Edge Function**: Processes the queue and deletes actual files from Supabase Storage
4. **Fallback**: Vercel cron job at `/api/cron/cleanup-videos` as backup

## Recommendations:

1. âœ… **Already Implemented**: Vercel cron job as fallback for cleanup
2. âœ… **Already Fixed**: Video credits default value (was 10, now 6)
3. âœ… **Already Created**: Admin dashboard component to monitor cleanup status
4. **Consider**: Adding email notifications when content is about to expire (Pro users)
5. **Consider**: Adding a grace period or archive option for Pro users

## Summary:

The storage retention system is **fully consistent** with the pricing page claims. All content types (icons, SVGs, videos) follow the advertised retention periods:
- Free/Starter: 7 days
- Pro: 30 days

The cleanup system is robust with multiple layers:
- Automatic database triggers
- Scheduled pg_cron jobs
- Vercel cron backup
- Edge Function for actual file deletion

The only issue found was a minor discrepancy in the default video credits (10 vs 6), which has been corrected.
