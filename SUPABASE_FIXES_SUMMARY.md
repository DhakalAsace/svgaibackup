# Supabase Database Fixes Summary

Date: 2025-01-21

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Added RLS Policy for storage_cleanup_queue
- **Issue**: Table had RLS enabled but no policies defined
- **Fix**: Added "Service role only access" policy
- **Impact**: Secured the table so only backend services can access it

### 2. ✅ Added Missing Policies for subscriptions Table  
- **Issue**: Only SELECT policy existed, missing INSERT/UPDATE
- **Fix**: Added service role policies for INSERT and UPDATE operations
- **Impact**: Ensures subscription data can only be modified by backend webhook handlers

### 3. ✅ Added DELETE Policy for generated_videos
- **Issue**: Users couldn't delete their own videos
- **Fix**: Added policy allowing users to delete their own videos
- **Impact**: Users now have full control over their generated content

### 4. ✅ Documented Monitoring Tables Status
- **Issue**: TypeScript types included tables that don't exist in database
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive documentation comment explaining the situation
- **Impact**: Prevents confusion and guides future development decisions

### 5. ✅ Added Performance Indexes
Created indexes for frequently queried columns:
- `idx_profiles_stripe_customer_id` - Speeds up webhook customer lookups
- `idx_generated_videos_user_created` - Optimizes user video queries
- `idx_daily_limits_lookup` - Improves rate limiting checks
- `idx_webhook_events_stripe_event_id` - Speeds up webhook deduplication
- `idx_subscriptions_user_id` - Optimizes subscription lookups

## Verification Steps

1. **Check RLS Policies**:
```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('storage_cleanup_queue', 'subscriptions', 'generated_videos')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

2. **Check Indexes**:
```sql
SELECT tablename, indexname 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Track query performance improvements from new indexes
2. **Monitoring System**: Decide whether to create the monitoring tables or remove the unused code
3. **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic database audits to catch similar issues early

## No Breaking Changes

All fixes maintain backward compatibility:
- RLS policies are additive (don't affect existing access patterns)
- Indexes improve performance without changing functionality
- Documentation changes are comments only

The database is now more secure, performant, and properly documented.
