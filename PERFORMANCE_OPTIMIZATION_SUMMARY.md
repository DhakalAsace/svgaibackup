# Performance Optimization Summary

## Lighthouse Score Improvements

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Render-Blocking CSS (LCP)**
   - Moved critical CSS inline
   - Lazy-loaded non-critical CSS (color-fixes.css)
   - Created minimal critical.css for above-the-fold content

2. **JavaScript Bundle Size (TBT)**
   - Created optimized hero-minimal.tsx component
   - Split hero functionality into smaller chunks
   - Improved code splitting in webpack config
   - Added dedicated chunks for large dependencies (supabase, codemirror)
   - Lazy-loaded monitoring components

3. **Code Splitting**
   - Dynamic imports for all non-critical components
   - Lazy loading for modals and advanced features
   - Optimized package imports in next.config.mjs

4. **Accessibility Contrast**
   - Already fixed in color-fixes.css
   - Ensures WCAG AA compliance for all text

5. **Font Loading**
   - Montserrat already configured with font-display: swap
   - Added preload directives for critical resources

6. **Additional Optimizations**
   - Added performance monitoring component
   - Preloaded critical images (logo, laurel, star)
   - Added prefetch for likely navigation paths
   - Enabled CSS optimization in Next.js

## Expected Improvements:

- **Performance Score**: 73 → 85+ (target)
- **LCP**: 5.6s → <2.5s (good threshold)
- **TBT**: 280ms → <200ms (good threshold)
- **FCP**: Should remain fast
- **CLS**: Already at 0 (perfect)

## Next Steps:

1. Deploy changes and re-run Lighthouse
2. Monitor real user metrics via Web Vitals
3. Consider implementing service worker for offline support
4. Optimize images with next/image if not already done
5. Consider implementing resource hints based on user behavior
