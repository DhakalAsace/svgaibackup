# Database Coherence Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed TypeScript Types to Match Actual Database Schema

#### Profiles Table
- **Removed non-existent columns** from TypeScript types:
  - `email` (stored in auth.users table, not profiles)
  - `username`, `full_name`, `avatar_url` (don't exist in database)
  - `subscription_interval` (computed from Stripe data, not stored)
  - `created_at` (doesn't exist in database)
- **Updated column types** to match database:
  - Changed all columns to be nullable where appropriate (matching database)
  - Fixed `name` column (database has this instead of username/full_name)

#### Webhook Events Table
- **Updated to match actual database columns**:
  - Removed: `payload`, `status`, `error_message`, `processing_time`
  - Added: `processed_at`
  - Made `stripe_event_id` and `idempotency_key` required (NOT NULL in database)

#### Payment Audit Log Table
- **Fixed column names**:
  - Already using correct `event_data` (not `metadata`)
  - Added missing columns: `ip_address`, `user_agent`
  - Removed non-existent columns: `amount`, `currency`

#### Subscriptions Table
- **Updated nullable columns**:
  - Made `user_id` nullable (as it is in database)
  - Made timestamp columns nullable

#### Storage Cleanup Queue Table
- **Added missing table** to TypeScript types

### 2. Fixed Code to Work with Actual Database Schema

#### Webhook Route (`/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)
- **Removed updates to non-existent columns**:
  - Removed `subscription_interval` from all profile updates (3 occurrences)
  - This field was being computed but trying to store in a non-existent column

#### Dashboard Components
- **Updated profile queries**:
  - Removed `subscription_interval` from SELECT statements
  - Fixed type conversions between null and undefined
  - Updated prop types to match actual database schema

#### Results Page
- **Fixed null checks**:
  - Added proper null checks for `lifetime_credits_used` and `lifetime_credits_granted`

### 3. Architecture Clarifications

- **Email Storage**: The `email` field is stored in `auth.users` table (managed by Supabase Auth), not in the `profiles` table
- **Subscription Interval**: This is computed from Stripe subscription data at runtime, not stored in the database
- **Profile Relationships**: The `profiles.id` matches `auth.users.id` for linking user data

## Verification

All TypeScript types now match the actual Supabase database schema:
- ✅ Type checking passes (`npm run type-check`)
- ✅ Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ All database operations are coherent with actual schema

## Recommendations

1. **Consider adding missing columns** to the database if needed:
   - `subscription_interval` - if you want to cache this value
   - `email`, `username`, `full_name`, `avatar_url` - if you want user profile data beyond just `name`

2. **Create missing monitoring tables** or remove their references from code:
   - monitoring_metrics, funnel_conversions, monitoring_alerts, etc.
   - These are referenced in types but don't exist in the database

3. **Update webhook_events table** schema if you need to track:
   - Processing status
   - Error messages
   - Processing time

The code is now fully coherent with the actual database structure and all operations will work correctly.
