# Converter Issues Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **"sharp is not defined" errors** - Fixed by creating a client-safe wrapper that loads converters dynamically
2. **AI file validation** - Fixed to accept both `.ai` and `.pdf` files
3. **EPERM error on Windows** - Created helper scripts for starting the dev server

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Client Wrapper (`/lib/converters/client-wrapper.ts`)
- Safely loads converters in browser environment
- Uses dynamic imports to prevent server-side code from loading
- Returns proper error messages if converter fails to load

### 2. Updated Converter Interface (`/components/converter-interface.tsx`)
- Now uses the client wrapper to load converters
- Shows loading state while converter loads
- Accepts both `.ai` and `.pdf` files for AI converter

### 3. Created Helper Scripts
- `start-dev.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows
- `start-dev.bat` - Batch file for easier use
- Added npm scripts: `dev:clean` and `dev:fresh`

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use the batch file (Windows)
```bash
./start-dev.bat
```

### Option 2: Use npm scripts
```bash
# Clear cache and start fresh
npm run dev:fresh

# Or just clear Next.js cache
npm run dev:clean
```

### Option 3: Regular npm dev (if no EPERM errors)
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What This Fixes

1. **Browser Compatibility** - All converters now properly detect browser environment and use appropriate implementations
2. **No More "sharp is not defined"** - Sharp (server-only library) is never loaded in the browser
3. **AI File Support** - AI converter now accepts both .ai and .pdf files as expected
4. **Windows Permission Issues** - Helper scripts handle process cleanup properly

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:
1. Start the dev server using one of the methods above
2. Try converting:
   - WebP to SVG
   - SVG to PNG
   - SVG to WebP
   - AI to SVG (with both .ai and .pdf files)

All converters should work without "sharp is not defined" errors.
