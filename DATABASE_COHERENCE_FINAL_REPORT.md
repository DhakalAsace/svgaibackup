# Database Coherence Final Report

Date: 2025-01-21

## ✅ Cleanup Actions Completed

### 1. Dead Code Removed
- **Monitoring System**: Removed entire `/lib/monitoring/` directory (6 files)
- **Funnel Tracking**: Removed `lib/funnel-tracking.ts` (non-existent table)
- **Server Analytics**: Removed `lib/analytics/server-analytics.ts` (non-existent table)
- **Dashboard Pages**: Removed monitoring/analytics/performance dashboard pages
- **Hooks**: Removed `use-funnel-tracking.ts`, updated `use-enhanced-analytics.ts`
- **Backup Files**: Removed `.backup` files and build outputs

**Impact**: ~3,000+ lines of dead code removed, cleaner codebase

### 2. References Updated
- Fixed imports in `use-enhanced-analytics.ts`
- Updated `lib/seo/monitoring.ts` to remove monitoring endpoint calls
- Removed monitoring-related API endpoint references

## ✅ Database & Code Coherence Verified

### SVG Operations

**svg_designs table**:
- ✅ Stores user-generated SVGs with proper fields
- ✅ RLS policies allow users to manage their own designs
- ✅ Code correctly inserts with user_id, prompt, svg_content, title
- ✅ Public designs can be viewed by anyone (is_public flag)

**daily_generation_limits table**:
- ✅ Tracks generation limits for both authenticated and anonymous users
- ✅ Anonymous users: 2 generations per day (IP-based)
- ✅ Authenticated users: Based on subscription tier
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of records older than 7 days

### Video Operations & Expiration

**generated_videos table**:
- ✅ Stores AI-generated videos with proper expiration dates
- ✅ Retention periods correctly implemented:
  - Free tier: 7 days
  - Starter tier: 7 days  
  - Pro tier: 30 days
- ✅ Users can now DELETE their own videos (policy added)

**Cleanup Process**:
- ✅ `cleanup_expired_videos()` function exists and works
- ✅ Expired videos are added to `storage_cleanup_queue`
- ✅ Edge function processes the queue to delete from storage
- ✅ Database records are deleted after storage cleanup

### Credit System

**profiles table**:
- ✅ Tracks both lifetime and monthly credits
- ✅ `lifetime_credits_granted`: Default 6 for free users
- ✅ `monthly_credits`: Set based on subscription tier
- ✅ Credit deduction happens AFTER successful generation
- ✅ Real-time updates via postgres_changes

**Credit Costs**:
- ✅ SVG Generation: 1 credit
- ✅ Video Generation: 6 credits
- ✅ Properly checked before allowing operations

### Subscription Management

**subscriptions table**:
- ✅ Now has INSERT/UPDATE policies for service role
- ✅ Synced with profiles table via webhook handlers
- ✅ Tier determines monthly credits and retention periods

## 🔍 Current State Summary

### Database Tables (8 total)
1. **profiles** - User profiles with credits/subscription ✅
2. **svg_designs** - User-generated SVGs ✅
3. **daily_generation_limits** - Rate limiting ✅
4. **webhook_events** - Stripe webhook tracking ✅
5. **payment_audit_log** - Payment audit trail ✅
6. **generated_videos** - Video generation tracking ✅
7. **subscriptions** - Subscription records ✅
8. **storage_cleanup_queue** - Cleanup tasks ✅

### Key Coherence Points
- ✅ All database operations use existing tables
- ✅ RLS policies properly secure user data
- ✅ Expiration logic matches pricing tiers
- ✅ Credit system prevents overuse
- ✅ Cleanup processes maintain storage efficiency

### Performance Optimizations Added
- 5 strategic indexes for common queries
- Improved webhook customer lookups
- Faster user video queries
- Optimized rate limiting checks

## 🎯 System is Now Coherent

The codebase and database are now fully coherent:
1. **No dead code** referencing non-existent tables
2. **All operations** use properly secured, existing tables
3. **Expiration/deletion** works correctly per pricing tier
4. **Credit system** properly tracks and limits usage
5. **Performance** optimized with strategic indexes

### Icon Generation Verification
- ✅ Icons are generated via `/ai-icon-generator` page
- ✅ API endpoint `/api/generate-icon` handles icon-specific generation
- ✅ Icons stored in same `svg_designs` table with `tags: ['icon']`
- ✅ Icon-specific styles supported (icon/broken_line, icon/colored_outline, etc.)
- ✅ Credits properly deducted (1 credit per icon)
- ✅ Same rate limiting and authentication checks apply

The system is production-ready with proper data retention, security, and cleanup processes. Both SVG and icon generation flows are coherent with the database structure.
