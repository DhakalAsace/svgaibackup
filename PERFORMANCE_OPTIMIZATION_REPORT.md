## Next Steps

1. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Run Lighthouse Test**
   ```bash
   npm run vitals:url http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Monitor in Production**
   - Use Vercel Analytics to track real-world performance
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals
   - Check for any new bottlenecks

## Additional Recommendations

1. **CDN Configuration**
   - Ensure Vercel Edge Network is properly caching static assets
   - Configure proper cache headers for converter pages

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Consider converting remaining PNGs to WebP
   - Implement responsive image loading

3. **Database Queries**
   - Add indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Implement query result caching

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for performance regressions
   - Track conversion rates vs. page speed

All optimizations have been implemented following Next.js best practices and should result in a significant performance improvement.
