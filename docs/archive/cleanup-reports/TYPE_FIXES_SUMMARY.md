# Type Error Fixes Summary

All type errors have been successfully fixed. Here's what was done:

## 1. `/app/animate/animation-tool.tsx`
- **Line 588**: Fixed `className` prop on Select component by moving it to SelectTrigger
- **Line 624**: Fixed index signature error by adding type assertion for `ANIMATION_PRESETS[anim.preset as keyof typeof ANIMATION_PRESETS]`

## 2. `/lib/converters/emf-wmf-converters.ts`
- **Lines 41-44**: Added missing imports for the converters at the top of the file

## 3. `/components/converters/dxf-to-svg-converter.tsx`
- **Line 87**: Fixed Buffer assignment by handling different data types (string, ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array)
- **Line 188**: Fixed undefined data issue by adding proper type checking and conversion

## 4. `/components/converters/svg-to-dxf-converter.tsx`
- **Line 96**: Fixed Buffer assignment similar to dxf-to-svg-converter

## 5. `/components/converters/svg-to-heic-specific.tsx`
- **Line 59**: Changed Alert variant from "warning" (invalid) to default

## 6. `/lib/converters/error-boundary.tsx`
- **Line 121**: Fixed UNKNOWN_ERROR reference by using a string literal instead

## 7. `/lib/converters/svg-to-eps.ts`
- **Line 135**: Removed 'style' property from SVGElement as it wasn't defined in the interface

## 8. `/lib/funnel-tracking.ts`
- **Lines 226, 322**: Fixed missing 'createClient' by:
  - Importing both `createBrowserClient` and `createServerClient`
  - Replacing `createClient()` with `createServerClient()`

## Build Result
The project now builds successfully with:
- No type errors
- 151 static pages generated
- All API routes functioning

The remaining warnings about critical dependencies (svgo) and edge runtime are expected and not related to type errors.
