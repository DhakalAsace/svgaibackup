# Sharp Error Solution Summary

## The Problem
The error "WebP to SVG conversion failed: sharp is not defined" was occurring because:
1. Webpack was trying to bundle server-side modules (like sharp) into client-side code
2. The dynamic route `/convert/[converter]/page.js` was including references to sharp

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Isolated WebP to SVG Converter
- File: `/lib/converters/webp-to-svg-isolated.ts`
- This converter doesn't use any base classes that might import sharp
- Uses only imagetracerjs which works in the browser

### 2. Updated Client Wrapper
- Modified `/lib/converters/client-wrapper.ts` to use the isolated converter
- This ensures WebP to SVG never loads any code that references sharp

### 3. Fixed Import in converter-interface.tsx
- Changed from importing from `@/lib/converters` (which loads all converters)
- To importing only needed utilities from specific files

### 4. Updated Webpack Configuration
- Added sharp to resolve.fallback
- Added IgnorePlugin to ignore sharp imports in client builds
- Only externalizes modules on server-side builds

## Testing the Fix
1. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/convert/webp-to-svg`
3. Try converting a WebP file
4. The conversion should work without "sharp is not defined" error

## Key Learnings
1. Always be careful with barrel exports (index.ts) that import all modules
2. Use dynamic imports for converters to prevent loading unused code
3. Server-only dependencies should be properly isolated
4. Webpack configuration is crucial for handling native modules

## If Issues Persist
1. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
2. Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check browser console for any stack traces
4. The isolated converter should bypass all sharp-related code
