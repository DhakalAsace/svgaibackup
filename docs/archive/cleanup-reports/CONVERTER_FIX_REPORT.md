# GIF and BMP to SVG Converter Fix Report

## Problem Summary
Both GIF to SVG and BMP to SVG converters were using `sharp` library, which is server-side only. This prevented them from working in browser environments, despite being marked as `isSupported: true` in the converter configuration.

## Issues Found
1. **GIF to SVG** (`/lib/converters/gif-to-svg.ts`):
   - Used `sharp` for frame extraction
   - Marked as `isClientSide: false`
   - Could not run in browser environment

2. **BMP to SVG** (`/lib/converters/bmp-to-svg.ts`):
   - Used `sharp` for BMP decoding
   - Marked as `isClientSide: false` 
   - Could not run in browser environment

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. GIF to SVG Converter
- ✅ Replaced `sharp` dependency with Canvas API
- ✅ Added `extractGifFrameCanvas()` function using Image and Canvas elements
- ✅ Added `imageDataToPngBuffer()` for potrace compatibility
- ✅ Added browser compatibility checks
- ✅ Updated `isClientSide: true`
- ✅ Added proper error handling for browser environment detection

### 2. BMP to SVG Converter  
- ✅ Replaced `sharp` dependency with Canvas API
- ✅ Added `decodeBmpCanvas()` function using Image and Canvas elements
- ✅ Added `imageDataToPngBuffer()` for potrace compatibility
- ✅ Added browser compatibility checks
- ✅ Updated `isClientSide: true`
- ✅ Added proper error handling for browser environment detection

### 3. Common Improvements
- ✅ Added imports for browser utility functions
- ✅ Enhanced metadata to include original format and dimensions
- ✅ Updated progress callbacks for better user experience
- ✅ Maintained compatibility with existing ConversionHandler interface

## Technical Details

### Canvas API Implementation
Both converters now use the following approach:
1. Create `Blob` from input `Buffer` with appropriate MIME type
2. Create `Image` element and load blob via object URL
3. Draw image to `Canvas` element (automatically extracts first frame for GIFs)
4. Extract `ImageData` using `getImageData()`
5. Convert `ImageData` back to PNG buffer for potrace processing
6. Clean up object URLs to prevent memory leaks

### Browser Compatibility
- Requires Canvas API support (all modern browsers)
- Includes fallback error messages for unsupported environments
- Properly detects browser vs server environment

## Files Modified
- `/lib/converters/gif-to-svg.ts` - Complete rewrite for client-side compatibility
- `/lib/converters/bmp-to-svg.ts` - Complete rewrite for client-side compatibility

## Testing Status
- ✅ Import tests pass
- ✅ `isClientSide` flags correctly set to `true`
- ✅ Browser compatibility detection works
- ✅ Function signatures maintained
- ✅ Error handling implemented

## Next Steps
1. Integration testing with actual GIF/BMP files
2. Performance testing with various image sizes
3. Cross-browser compatibility testing
4. End-to-end testing in converter pages

## Impact
Both GIF and BMP to SVG converters are now **CLIENT-SIDE COMPATIBLE** and can run in browser environments without requiring server-side processing.
