## Tasks Requiring Manual Completion ⚠️

### Package Installation Required
```bash
# Install rate limiting packages
npm install @upstash/ratelimit @upstash/redis

# Install testing packages (if not already installed)
npm install --save-dev jest @jest/globals @types/jest
```

### Environment Configuration Required
1. **Upstash Redis Setup**
   - Create Upstash account at https://upstash.com
   - Create a Redis database
   - Copy REST URL and REST Token
   - Update `.env.local` with actual values:
     ```
     UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_actual_url
     UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_actual_token
     ```

2. **Stripe Webhook Secret**
   - Add to `.env.local` if not already present:
     ```
     STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
     ```

### Code Activation Required
After installing packages, uncomment the following:

1. **In `/app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts`**:
   - Uncomment the rate limiter import (line 7)
   - Uncomment the rate limiting code (lines 25-34)

2. **In `/app/api/create-portal-session/route.ts`**:
   - Uncomment the rate limiter import (line 6)
   - Uncomment the rate limiting code (lines 22-31)

3. **In `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`**:
   - Uncomment the rate limiter import (line 8)
   - Uncomment the rate limiting code (lines 104-114)

### Testing Required
1. Run the payment flow test:
   ```bash
   npm run test:payments
   ```

2. Test webhook security manually:
   ```bash
   # Test with invalid signature
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe \
     -H "stripe-signature: invalid" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"type":"checkout.session.completed"}'
   ```

3. Test rate limiting (after setup):
   ```bash
   # Run multiple requests quickly to test rate limiting
   for i in {1..15}; do
     curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/create-checkout-session \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"tier":"starter","interval":"monthly"}'
   done
   ```

### Production Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables set in production
- [ ] Stripe webhook endpoint configured in Dashboard
- [ ] Upstash Redis instance created and configured
- [ ] All packages installed
- [ ] Rate limiting code uncommented and tested
- [ ] Security headers verified in production
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Incident response team notified of procedures

## Security Improvements Summary

### What's Now Protected
1. **Webhook replay attacks** - Prevented by timestamp validation and idempotency keys
2. **Race conditions** - Fixed with database row locking
3. **Request flooding** - Rate limiting ready to activate
4. **Payment tracking** - Full audit trail implemented
5. **Configuration security** - Centralized with environment variables

### Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. **Rate limiting not active** - Requires package installation
2. **No active monitoring** - Requires integration with monitoring service
3. **Manual webhook replay** - Needs automation setup
4. **No automated testing** - CI/CD pipeline needed

## Estimated Time to Production
- **With all manual steps completed**: 2-3 days
- **Minimal viable security** (without rate limiting): 1 day
- **Full production readiness**: 1 week (including monitoring setup and testing)

## Next Steps Priority
1. Install required npm packages
2. Set up Upstash Redis
3. Uncomment and test rate limiting
4. Configure production environment variables
5. Set up monitoring service integration
6. Run comprehensive security testing
7. Deploy to staging environment
8. Perform load testing
9. Deploy to production
