# Payment Security Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines security procedures for handling payment-related incidents and maintaining payment system security.

## Daily Security Checks

### 1. Webhook Health Monitoring
- Check webhook delivery success rate in Stripe Dashboard
- Review any failed webhooks and investigate causes
- Verify webhook event processing in `webhook_events` table

### 2. Payment Audit Review
- Query `payment_audit_log` for unusual patterns
- Check for multiple failed payment attempts from same user
- Monitor for suspicious checkout session creation patterns

### 3. Credit Usage Anomalies
- Review users with unusually high credit usage
- Check for potential credit exploitation attempts
- Verify credit deduction accuracy

## Incident Response Procedures

### Suspected Fraud
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Block affected user accounts
   - Review all transactions from suspicious IP addresses
   - Check for related accounts using same payment method

2. **Investigation**
   - Query payment audit logs for user activity
   - Review Stripe logs for payment patterns
   - Check for webhook manipulation attempts

3. **Remediation**
   - Refund legitimate affected users
   - Update security rules to prevent recurrence
   - Document incident for future reference

### Webhook Failures
1. **Detection**
   - Monitor webhook success rate < 95%
   - Check for consistent failure patterns

2. **Response**
   - Verify webhook endpoint is accessible
   - Check webhook signing secret is correct
   - Review server logs for errors

3. **Recovery**
   - Use Stripe CLI to replay failed webhooks
   - Manually sync affected subscriptions
   - Update user records as needed

### Payment Processing Errors
1. **Common Issues**
   - Duplicate subscription attempts
   - Failed credit deductions
   - Subscription sync mismatches

2. **Resolution Steps**
   - Check user's Stripe customer record
   - Verify subscription status in database
   - Run manual sync if needed
   - Contact user if manual intervention required

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management
- Rotate Stripe API keys quarterly
- Use restricted keys for specific operations
- Never commit keys to version control
- Monitor key usage in Stripe Dashboard

### Database Security
- Regular backups of payment-related tables
- Row-level security on sensitive data
- Audit all admin access to payment data
- Encrypt sensitive fields at rest

### Code Security
- Code review all payment-related changes
- Test payment flows in Stripe test mode
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate all user input before processing

## Monitoring Setup

### Alerts to Configure
1. **High Priority**
   - Webhook failure rate > 5%
   - Checkout completion rate < 70%
   - Multiple failed payments from same user

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Unusual credit usage patterns
   - Subscription sync mismatches
   - High refund rate

3. **Low Priority**
   - Successful payment notifications
   - Daily summary reports
   - Weekly reconciliation results
