## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL MYTH-BUSTING

### Common Misconceptions:

**MYTH**: "Terms of Service must include arbitration clauses"
**REALITY**: Completely optional. Many companies avoid them due to cost.

**MYTH**: "You need extensive disclaimers for everything"
**REALITY**: Only specific disclaimers are legally required (warranties in some provinces).

**MYTH**: "All-caps makes terms more enforceable"
**REALITY**: No legal requirement. Clear, readable text is preferred by courts.

**MYTH**: "You must prohibit reverse engineering"
**REALITY**: Not required. May not be enforceable in some jurisdictions.

**MYTH**: "Severability clauses are mandatory"
**REALITY**: Helpful but not legally required. Courts apply severability anyway.
