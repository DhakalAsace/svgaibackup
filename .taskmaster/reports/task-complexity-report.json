		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Emergency Credential Rotation and Secrets Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the credential rotation task into phases: immediate rotation actions, secrets management implementation, environment separation, rotation policy setup, and verification steps. Each subtask should be independently executable with clear success criteria.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to critical security impact, multiple systems affected, need for careful coordination to avoid service disruption, and requirement for new infrastructure (secrets management system). Requires both immediate actions and long-term system changes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Critical SQL Injection Vulnerability",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: identifying and removing vulnerable code, implementing secure migration system using Supabase CLI, creating proper migration structure, updating deployment pipeline, and comprehensive testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to critical security nature and need to redesign migration approach. Relatively straightforward fix (deletion) but requires careful implementation of replacement system and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CSRF Protection",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure subtasks around: middleware setup for CSRF token generation/validation, form and AJAX integration, cookie configuration, API route updates, token refresh mechanism implementation, and comprehensive CSRF testing across all endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to need to touch many parts of the application, careful implementation to avoid breaking legitimate requests, and comprehensive testing requirements. Requires understanding of CSRF attack vectors and Next.js middleware."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Secure Webhook Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: webhook secret validation implementation, replay protection with idempotency keys, event logging system, retry mechanism with backoff, monitoring/alerting setup, and rate limiting for webhook endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple security concerns (validation, replay attacks, monitoring), need for database changes, and critical nature of payment webhooks. Requires careful error handling and extensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Row Level Security for Payment Tables",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: RLS policy creation for payment_audit_log, RLS policy creation for webhook_events, policy implementation for other payment tables, comprehensive testing of all policies, and documentation of RLS implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to critical security impact on payment data, need for careful policy design to balance security and functionality, and thorough testing requirements. Relatively straightforward Supabase implementation but high stakes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Input Validation and Sanitization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure around: Zod schema creation for each endpoint type, request size limit implementation, centralized validation middleware, XSS sanitization layer, file/URL validation, SVG-specific security validation, and comprehensive testing suite for all validation rules.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to need to analyze and validate every endpoint, create comprehensive schemas, implement multiple validation layers, and ensure no legitimate requests are broken. Requires deep understanding of various attack vectors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Enhanced Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: Redis infrastructure setup, tiered rate limit implementation, advanced fingerprinting system, sliding window algorithm implementation, Cloudflare DDoS configuration, CAPTCHA integration, circuit breaker implementation, and comprehensive load testing.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to distributed system requirements, multiple detection mechanisms, integration with external services (Redis, Cloudflare), and need for sophisticated algorithms. Requires careful performance consideration and extensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Payment Security Hardening",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: removing hardcoded values, implementing database-backed idempotency, server-side price validation, payment audit logging system, anomaly detection implementation, comprehensive webhook security, PCI compliance requirements, and extensive payment flow testing.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to critical nature of payment security, multiple vulnerability fixes needed, integration with Stripe best practices, PCI compliance requirements, and need for sophisticated fraud detection. Highest risk area requiring meticulous implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Security Testing Suite and CI/CD Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: security test suite structure creation, individual security test implementation (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.), CI/CD pipeline integration, automated scanning tool setup, pre-commit hook configuration, security dashboard creation, and penetration testing schedule setup.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to need for comprehensive test coverage, integration with multiple security tools, CI/CD pipeline modifications, and ongoing monitoring setup. Requires expertise in various security testing methodologies and tools."
