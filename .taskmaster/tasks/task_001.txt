# Task ID: 1
# Title: Configure Existing Next.js Project for New Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update existing Next.js 14 project configuration to support new converter pages and tools while maintaining current functionality
# Details:
1. Review existing project structure and dependencies
2. Install additional dependencies for converters: npm install potrace sharp-svg canvas-to-svg svg2img
3. Update next.config.js for new routes and ISR configurations
4. Extend environment variables for new tool configurations
5. Create shared utilities for file conversion operations
6. Setup new route folders without affecting existing pages
7. Ensure compatibility with existing credit and payment systems

NOTE: This task requires deep understanding of the existing codebase and must be completed by the main agent before other features can be built. It involves critical configuration updates that affect all subsequent tasks.

Agent: Main (orchestrator) - Must complete first

# Test Strategy:
Verify existing pages (/, /ai-icon-generator) continue working, new dependencies install without conflicts, TypeScript compilation passes, development server runs without errors

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and configure new dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install required npm packages for the new features and ensure they're compatible with the existing dependency tree
### Details:
Run npm install for required packages including any type definitions. Check for version conflicts with existing packages. Update package-lock.json accordingly.

## 2. Update TypeScript and build configurations [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Modify tsconfig.json, next.config.mjs, and other build configuration files to support new features
### Details:
Add necessary compiler options, path aliases, and module resolution settings. Ensure build process accommodates new file structures and dependencies.

## 3. Set up environment variables and secrets [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure environment variable structure for new features including API keys and service endpoints
### Details:
Update .env.example with new variables. Document required environment variables. Ensure proper validation and type safety for environment variables.

## 4. Create base utility functions and helpers [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Develop foundational utility functions that will be used across the new features
### Details:
Create utility functions for common operations like data validation, formatting, API response handling, and error management that align with existing patterns.
<info added on 2025-06-25T06:53:40.603Z>
Created comprehensive converter type definitions and validation schemas for all 40 converter formats. Established base converter interfaces and format-specific validation rules.

Next implementation steps:
1. Error handling utilities - Create standardized error classes and handlers for converter operations
2. Individual converter implementations - Build converter functions for each format pair (PNG→SVG, SVG→PNG, JPG→SVG, etc.)
3. Client-side converter wrapper - Develop unified client-side interface for all converters with progress tracking
4. Server-side API utilities - Create API route handlers and response formatting for converter endpoints

<info added on 2025-06-25T07:05:40.360Z>
Successfully created core converter infrastructure including:
- Comprehensive error handling system with custom error classes for validation, conversion, and unsupported format errors
- Implemented 12 converter functions covering major format pairs: PNG→SVG, SVG→PNG, JPG→SVG, SVG→JPG, WebP→SVG, SVG→WebP, GIF→SVG, SVG→GIF, BMP→SVG, SVG→BMP, PDF→SVG, SVG→PDF, ICO→SVG, SVG→ICO
- Built centralized converter registry for dynamic converter lookup and management
- Developed unified client-side wrapper with progress tracking, error handling, and format validation
- Created server-side API utilities with standardized response formatting and error handling

Remaining implementation needs:
- Additional 28 converters to reach full 40 converter support (TIFF, EPS, AI, DXF, EMF, WMF, and other specialized formats)
- Integration testing for all converter combinations
- Performance optimization for large file conversions
- Documentation for converter API usage

<info added on 2025-06-25T09:21:36.138Z>
Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors across the converter system:
- Added proper type definitions for potrace library including all configuration options
- Corrected SVGO plugin configurations to use proper plugin array syntax
- Fixed Buffer.from() usage by ensuring proper type conversions for base64 data
- Resolved module import/export mismatches between CommonJS and ES modules
- Updated all converter implementations to pass strict type checking
- Verified npm run type-check now completes successfully with no errors

## 5. Design and document route structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Plan the API route structure and page routing for new features following Next.js App Router conventions
### Details:
Create route planning documentation. Define API endpoints, page routes, and middleware requirements. Ensure naming conventions match existing patterns.
<info added on 2025-06-25T07:34:35.040Z>
The planned route structure has been implemented with the following components:

Converter Directory Structure:
- /app/convert/layout.tsx - Provides metadata configuration and consistent layout for all converter pages
- /app/convert/converter-config.ts - Central configuration file containing all 40 converter definitions with SEO metadata, search volumes, and URL mappings
- /app/convert/[converter]/page.tsx - Dynamic route handler using generateStaticParams for static generation of all converter pages
- /app/convert/page.tsx - Hub page displaying all available converters with search functionality

Key Implementation Details:
- Converters are statically generated at build time for optimal SEO performance
- Each converter includes title, description, keywords, and monthly search volume data
- URL structure handles duplicate keywords through proper mapping (e.g., both "svg to png" and "svg to png converter" route to same page)
- Placeholder UI components ready for "coming soon" converters while maintaining SEO value
- Route types properly categorized (convert, generate, learn) for future expansion
- Metadata generation follows Next.js 14 app router patterns for optimal search engine indexing

## 6. Verify compatibility with existing auth and database systems [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Test and ensure new configurations work seamlessly with current Supabase auth and database setup
### Details:
Run integration tests with existing auth flows. Verify database connections work with new configs. Check middleware compatibility.

## 7. Update development tooling and scripts [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Modify package.json scripts, linting rules, and development tools to support new features
### Details:
Add new npm scripts for development tasks. Update ESLint and Prettier configurations. Configure any new development tools or testing frameworks.
