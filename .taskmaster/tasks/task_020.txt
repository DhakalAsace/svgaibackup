# Task ID: 20
# Title: Integration, UI Polish, and Production Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate all converters into the main application UI with polish and production optimizations
# Details:
Update converter registry to include all 17 new converters with proper metadata. Implement unified UI with format detection, drag-and-drop support, and batch processing. Add real-time progress indicators using Web Workers for non-blocking conversion. Create format-specific option panels (projection angle for STL, page selection for TIFF, etc.). Implement conversion history and undo functionality. Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features. Optimize bundle size with code splitting per converter. Setup monitoring and error reporting.

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end tests for complete user workflows, accessibility testing with screen readers, performance testing under load, bundle size analysis, production smoke tests, user acceptance testing with real users

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement converter registry and unified UI framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create centralized converter registry system and build the unified UI components for all converters
### Details:
Set up a converter registry that manages all converter instances, metadata, and capabilities. Build the unified UI framework with shared components for file input, output display, and conversion controls. Implement dynamic routing and converter loading based on the selected format.

## 2. Integrate Web Workers for non-blocking conversions [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Implement Web Worker architecture to offload conversion processing from the main thread
### Details:
Create Web Worker wrappers for each converter type. Implement message passing between main thread and workers. Add progress reporting and cancellation capabilities. Handle worker fallbacks for unsupported browsers. Ensure proper cleanup and memory management.

## 3. Build format-specific options UI and batch processing system [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Create dynamic options panels for each format and implement batch conversion capabilities
### Details:
Design and implement format-specific option panels (e.g., SVG optimization levels, PNG compression, PDF quality). Build batch processing UI with queue management, progress tracking, and bulk operations. Add drag-and-drop support for multiple files and folder uploads.

## 4. Optimize performance and implement code splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Apply performance optimizations and set up intelligent code splitting for converter modules
### Details:
Implement dynamic imports for converter modules to reduce initial bundle size. Add lazy loading for format-specific components. Optimize conversion algorithms and implement caching strategies. Set up performance monitoring and establish performance budgets. Apply memoization and virtualization where applicable.

## 5. Deploy to production with comprehensive monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4
### Description: Execute production deployment with full monitoring, error tracking, and performance analytics
### Details:
Set up production build pipeline with optimizations. Configure CDN for static assets and implement edge caching. Deploy monitoring solutions for conversion metrics, error rates, and performance. Set up alerts for critical issues. Implement A/B testing framework for conversion UI variations. Create deployment rollback procedures.
