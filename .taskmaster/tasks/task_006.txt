Agent: Parallel worktree (feature/animation)

Implementation:
1. Create multiple SEO-optimized landing pages targeting keyword clusters
2. Build simple upload interface for SVG files (free)
3. Implement preset CSS animation selector (fade, rotate, bounce, slide, etc.) - all free
4. Create real-time animation preview using CSS animations (free)
5. Add free animated SVG download with embedded CSS
6. Add internal linking to SVG converters, galleries, and separate SVG to Video tool
7. Emphasize 100% free tool with no hidden costs or credit requirements

Development approach: This feature will be developed in a separate git worktree to enable parallel development. Once Task 1 (project setup) and basic conversion setup from Task 3 are complete, create worktree and develop/test in isolation before merging back to main branch.

# Test Strategy:
Test CSS animation performance across browsers, verify animated SVG export functionality works correctly with embedded animations, ensure clear messaging about free nature of tool, test file upload and animation preview functionality, validate SEO optimization across all 13 keywords and routing variations, test internal linking strategy. Test feature in isolation within worktree before integration.
