# Task ID: 19
# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Create extensive test suite covering all converters with real-world files and edge cases
# Details:
Develop test file repository with samples for each format including edge cases. Implement automated testing using Jest and Playwright for browser compatibility. Create performance benchmarks measuring conversion time, memory usage, and output quality. Setup visual regression testing comparing conversion outputs. Implement fuzz testing for parser robustness. Create test matrix covering different file sizes, complexities, and error conditions. Build converter comparison tool for quality metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each converter function, integration tests for full conversion pipeline, cross-browser tests on Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge, performance tests with files from 1KB to 50MB, memory leak detection, error recovery testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up test file repository with categorized samples [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a structured repository for test files including various formats (PNG, JPG, WebP, SVG, PDF) organized by file type, size, complexity, and edge cases
### Details:
Establish directory structure under /test-files with categories: basic (simple images), complex (gradients, transparency), edge-cases (corrupted, oversized), and performance (various file sizes). Include metadata files documenting each test case's purpose and expected outcomes.

## 2. Configure automated test runner with Jest and Playwright [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Set up Jest for unit/integration testing and Playwright for E2E converter testing with proper test suites, fixtures, and CI/CD integration
### Details:
Configure Jest with custom matchers for image comparison, set up Playwright for browser-based converter testing, create test utilities for file upload simulation, implement parallel test execution, and integrate with GitHub Actions for automated testing on PRs.

## 3. Implement performance benchmarking system with metrics tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Build a comprehensive performance measurement system that tracks conversion speed, memory usage, file size optimization, and quality metrics across all converters
### Details:
Create benchmark suite measuring conversion time per MB, memory peak usage, output file size ratio, implement performance regression detection, store historical metrics in database, generate performance reports with charts, and set up alerts for performance degradation.

## 4. Establish visual regression testing pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Implement automated visual comparison system to ensure conversion quality by comparing outputs against baseline images and detecting visual differences
### Details:
Integrate visual regression tools (Percy/Chromatic or custom solution), create baseline image sets for each converter, implement pixel-by-pixel comparison with configurable thresholds, handle expected variations (timestamps, metadata), and create approval workflow for intentional changes.

## 5. Develop fuzz testing and error recovery validation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Create comprehensive fuzz testing framework to test converters with malformed inputs and validate proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
### Details:
Implement fuzz testing to generate malformed files, test with corrupted headers, invalid formats, extreme dimensions, memory bombs, verify graceful error handling, test recovery mechanisms, validate security against malicious files, and ensure no crashes or memory leaks occur.
