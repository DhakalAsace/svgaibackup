# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize Performance for New Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement essential performance optimizations focused on Core Web Vitals and SEO requirements for new converter and tool pages
# Details:
1. Ensure Core Web Vitals pass (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1)
2. Implement lazy loading for gallery images
3. Configure basic caching headers for static content
4. Add simple loading states to prevent layout shift
5. Focus on meeting Google's SEO requirements

Agent: Main (optimization)

# Test Strategy:
Run Lighthouse audits focusing on Core Web Vitals, verify all metrics pass Google's thresholds, test lazy loading functionality, validate caching headers are properly set

# Subtasks:
## 1. Optimize for Core Web Vitals [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all pages meet Google's Core Web Vitals thresholds for LCP, INP, and CLS
### Details:
Measure current Core Web Vitals using Lighthouse, identify and fix LCP issues (target < 2.5s), optimize interaction responsiveness (INP < 200ms), eliminate layout shifts (CLS < 0.1), focus on quick wins that impact SEO

## 2. Implement lazy loading for gallery images [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add basic lazy loading to improve initial page load performance for image galleries
### Details:
Use native loading='lazy' attribute for images, implement intersection observer for galleries, ensure images below fold don't block initial render, add appropriate width/height attributes to prevent layout shift

## 3. Configure basic caching headers [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up simple caching headers for static assets to improve repeat visit performance
### Details:
Add Cache-Control headers for static assets (images, CSS, JS), use reasonable cache durations (e.g., 1 year for versioned assets), ensure proper cache invalidation on deployments, keep configuration simple and maintainable

## 4. Add simple loading states [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement basic loading states to prevent layout shift and improve perceived performance
### Details:
Add skeleton screens or placeholders for dynamic content, ensure consistent dimensions to prevent CLS, use CSS-only solutions where possible, focus on critical above-fold content

## 5. Verify SEO performance requirements [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Ensure all optimizations meet Google's SEO requirements and improve search visibility
### Details:
Run PageSpeed Insights on all key pages, verify Core Web Vitals pass in field data, check Google Search Console for any issues, document performance metrics for SEO team
