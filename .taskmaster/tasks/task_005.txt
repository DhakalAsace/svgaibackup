I'll analyze the user request and determine what new information should be added to the subtask's details.Looking at the user request and the current subtask details, I need to identify what new information should be added. The current details already mention most of the requested points, but the user wants to:

1. Emphasize that users can upload either static or animated SVGs
2. Clarify that animated SVGs would be created with their free animation tool
3. Reinforce that this is the premium conversion tool for any SVG to video or GIF transformation

The new information to append would be:

Users can upload either static SVGs to convert to video, or animated SVGs (created with our free animation tool) to convert to GIF/MP4 formats. This is the premium conversion tool for any SVG to video or GIF transformation.

<info added on 2025-06-25T16:48:33.234Z>
Successfully implemented SVG to Video/MP4 converter at /api/convert/svg-to-video with complete premium credit-based pricing tiers (Standard: 2 credits, HD: 3 credits, 4K: 5 credits). The converter features a polished drag-and-drop interface with real-time credit cost calculation, multiple output format support (MP4/GIF), customizable frame rates (24/30/60 fps), adjustable duration controls (1-60 seconds), and comprehensive error handling. The system is fully integrated with the existing authentication and credit consumption infrastructure, automatically deducting credits upon successful conversion and providing users with immediate feedback on their remaining balance.

## 5. Integrate credit consumption for SVG to Video only [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Connect SVG to Video tool to the existing credit system with appropriate deduction rates
### Details:
Implement credit checking before video conversion, deduction logic for each conversion operation, usage tracking, and error handling for insufficient credits. Editor and Optimizer remain completely free.
<info added on 2025-06-25T16:51:21.702Z>
The useCredits hook successfully integrates with the component to provide real-time credit balance display. Credit requirements are tiered based on video quality: 2 credits for standard resolution, 3 credits for HD (1080p), and 5 credits for 4K resolution. The component implements pre-conversion credit validation that prevents users from initiating conversions without sufficient credits. When users lack credits, the interface displays a clear "Insufficient Credits" state with a direct link to the pricing page for credit purchases. The authentication requirement is enforced at the component level, ensuring only logged-in users can access the video conversion feature. Post-conversion credit balance refresh is handled automatically to reflect the updated balance immediately after successful video generation.

I'll analyze the user's request and generate the appropriate update for the subtask.

The user has provided detailed implementation notes about how they've added contextual CTAs (Call-to-Actions) to the free tools to drive users toward the paid AI generation features. This appears to be an implementation update for subtask 5.6 "Add contextual CTAs and upgrade prompts to free tools".

Here's the new text to be added:

Completed implementation of comprehensive contextual CTAs across all free tools. In the SVG Editor, added timing-based CTAs that appear after 30 seconds as a floating prompt and after 45 seconds in the suggestions sidebar. Implemented intelligent error detection that triggers upgrade prompts after users encounter 5 or more validation errors, suggesting AI generation as a more efficient alternative. Added complexity detection algorithm that identifies when users are working with complex SVG structures and prompts them to try AI generation for better results.

Enhanced the SVG Optimizer with success-based CTAs that showcase the benefits of AI-generated SVGs after optimization completes. Implemented file size detection that triggers prompts for files larger than 50KB, suggesting AI generation for more efficient outputs. Added rotating testimonial section displaying user success stories with AI-generated SVGs to build trust and demonstrate value.

Created comparison charts strategically placed throughout the free tools showing clear differences between traditional manual SVG creation methods versus AI-powered generation in terms of time saved, quality achieved, and complexity handled. Updated the main navigation structure to include a dedicated 'Free Tools' link, improving discoverability and creating a clear pathway for users to explore free offerings before upgrading.

All CTAs are designed to be non-intrusive with dismiss options and are fully integrated with analytics tracking to measure conversion effectiveness. Utilized framer-motion library for smooth, professional animations that enhance user experience without being distracting. The entire implementation creates a strategic funnel guiding users naturally from free tool usage to discovering and adopting the premium AI generation features.
