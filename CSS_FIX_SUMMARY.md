# CSS Loading Issue - Summary

## Problem
The CSS is not loading in production, showing an unstyled page even though the performance has improved.

## Root Causes
1. **Custom build directory**: Using `.next-build` instead of default `.next`
2. **Static file serving**: The server may not be serving static files from the custom directory
3. **MIME type errors**: Server returning HTML instead of CSS files

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Rebuilt the project
- Removed `optimizeCss: false` to ensure CSS is properly generated
- Build completed successfully with CSS files in `.next-build/static/css/`

### 2. Server Configuration
The issue is that Next.js `start` command expects the build to be in `.next` directory by default.

## Quick Fix

To resolve this immediately:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the correct build directory
next start -p 3000

# Option 2: Set environment variable
NEXT_BUILD_DIR=.next-build npm start

# Option 3: Change build directory back to default
# Edit next.config.mjs and remove: distDir: '.next-build'
```

## Files Found
- CSS files exist: `/static/css/09252e565d12b689.css`
- Layout JS includes CSS: `layout-6783dc338dd78f58.js`

## Recommended Solution
Remove the custom `distDir` from next.config.mjs and use the default `.next` directory to avoid these issues.

The performance optimizations are working (Score: 70), but the CSS serving issue needs to be fixed for the site to display properly.
